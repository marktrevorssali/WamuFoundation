                Education is not about what you have, but what you’re willing to fight for. This boy, with dust rising around his tiny bare feet and the morning sun casting a golden glow on the red earth. He stands proudly with a battered board around his chest. With a faded uniform and rough hands but his eyes shining with a quiet fire.
                This blackboard, though old and scratched with edges worn out represents something much greater than its physical form.
                Just like this child, many others in different societies and regions do not have education as a routine but a privilege. His smile, so genuine, revealing a spirit unbroken by hardship but despite the challenges like lack of supplies, long walks to school or crowded classrooms with poor conditions. He still stands still and firm, 
                ready to write, learn and secure his future. The roughness of the board and the brightness in his eyes speak in volumes and tell a story of a child who is carrying not just a tool but a dream. A dream that involves changing his life and perhaps the life of those that surround him either family or friends.
                It might look as an old board but to him this is the door to his future, his ticket out of poverty and a simple shout out to the world that “I am ready to learn,” and that the future is built in glass towers but starts from where you can earn it. This boy’s smile is proof that he refuses to be defined by his limits and this is where we come in. 
                This boy’s determination is a call to those with power. Let’s give him more than just a dream but a tool to reach it. A new blackboard, pen, books and all to mention can create giant and huge leaps.
                This is not just charity but investment in a future leader, teacher and change maker. Be the reason he never has to carry a broken and scratched board again. Let’s be the hands that lift him higher. This is the time and moment to stand in or up and help this boy(and others like him) build the future he clearly believes in.
