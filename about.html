                "For Ubuntu ya Maisha" This statement is deeply derived from the sweet words of the mother land and 
                it reflects togetherness for Life. One can understand <i>for Ubuntu ya Maisha</i> as 
                "The spirit of <b>togetherness</b> for life". Promoting, building, growing, developing
                greater lives of different individuals showing Unity and care for the development of those that might
                feel abandoned. But with Wamu Foundation, they are never abandoned!

            comes to life. <br>This website was made by him for the people of Uganda with gorgeous kind hearts to forward a hand towards the children of
            Uganda and the disabled experiencing a difficult life so as to ensure that there is an end to that suffering they face and create smiles and real
            hope amongst them.</i>
